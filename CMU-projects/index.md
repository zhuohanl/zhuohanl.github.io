### Text Analysis and Image Analysis
- Situation: For the course of Unstructured Data Analysis I individually completed a series of projects
- Projects:
  - Frequency analysis and co-occurrence analysis on text corpus (spaCy)
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling on ~180,000 mobile applications (sklearn)
  - Email spam detection by classifiers (sklearn KNN, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and SVM kernels)
  - Sentiment analysis on 1,600,000 tweets (keras, simple RNN, LSTM)
  - Image segmentation using Mask R-CNN and AWS GPU instance (Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, psycoco, etc)

### Data Mining
- Situation: My team of 5 people participated in a data challenge held by Rise Against Hunger, an NGO driven to end hunger by providing food and life-changing aid to the world’s most vulnerable.
- Task: We were requested to explore the data with data mining skills and answer a set of business questions.
- Action:
  - Understand the three datasets which include 802 attributes and 63,7673 instances.   
  - Preprocess, clean and select appropriate data for further analysis.
  - Explore the selected data using R, TABLEAU and IBM Watson analytics.
  - Apply appropriate data mining algorithms including classification (ZeroR, OneR, Simple Naïve Bayes, PRISM, J48) and clustering (SimpleKMeans).
- Result:
Based on the analysis above, provided meaningful business insights into questions such as “What are the connections between volunteering at events and donating”, “What are patterns/trends in the event hosts who are hosting along with Rise Against Hunger”, and “What fields are predictive or certain outcomes”.

### Data Warehousing
- Situation: My team of 3 people conducted a data warehousing project on the United States homicide dataset kept by FBI from 1980 to 2014, which includes 24 attributes and 638,454 instances.  
- Task: We raise a set of business questions and aim to address them with data warehouse and the associated reports;
- Action:
  - Design and develop a dimensional model (star schema) which includes 1 fact table and 5 dimension tables (date, location, weapon, agency and demographics), among which 2 dimension tables include Type II slowly changing dimension (SCD2) fields;
  - Implement the dimensional model by Extract-Transfer-Load (ETL) procedures, using tools including Microsoft SQL Server Database and Visual Studio SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) tools;
  - Use SQL to generate 5 reports to answer the previously raised business questions.
- Result:
Successfully deployed and delivered a SQL Server Database using dimensional model, and provided valuable business insights regarding how to reduce murder rate in United States.

### Big data and Large-scale computing
- Situation: My team of 4 people conducted a big data analytics project on the Million Song Dataset, an over 1GB freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks from 1954 to 2010.
- Task: We raise a set of business questions and aim to address them with big data and large-scale computing knowledge, techniques and tools;
- Actions:
  - Understand the data structure and use python to extract useful data for further analysis;
  - Utilize java and Hadoop MapReduce to process big data and generate answers for “song of the year” and “top 20 productive artists over the 56 years”;
  - Use java and Spark MLlib to run regression and Kmeans clustering algorithms to analyze “what makes a hot song”;
  - Use Python, scala and Spark MLlib to develop a personalized song recommendations system to recommend songs based on user rating on a sample set of songs.
- Result:
Delivered valuable business insights on “what makes a hot song” and a personalized song recommending system.

### Information System Capstone project
- Situation: A market research company in Australia has been conducting quarterly Litter Index Monitor Study for Australian government agencies.
- Task: My group of 5 people were responsible for exploring new digital tools to improve data analytics and reporting efficiency for the company.
- Actions:
  - Applied VBA programming to automate the generating of 63 Excel histogram, pie, bar, and stacked bar charts by “one-click” buttons;
  - Deployed the use of Tableau to enable the Company to disseminate data with a new tool which supports great extent of interaction;
  - Propose, design and implement a Microsoft SQL Server database to help the company transform the way to store, process and query data.
- Result:
Successfully shortened 3-week workload into one mouse click and tremendously improved business efficiency.

### Mobile app development
- Situation: A department of a large-scale public hospital in South Australia would like to digitalize the input, storage and retrieval of patient test data.
- Task: My team of 4 people were responsible for developing a database and a mobile app for the department use.
- Action:
  - Design and implement a comprehensive database to store patient test records;
  - Used React Native framework and JavaScript to design and develop an IOS mobile app for the nurses to input data, and for the doctors to search and view historical data.
- Result:
  - Completed the app and deployed it to iPad successfully;
  - The client would like us to publish it to Apple store. However, this is not commercial-level product so we are still considering;
